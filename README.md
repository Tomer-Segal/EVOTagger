## Setup and Requirements

**Hardware:** NVIDIA A100 GPU (80GB RAM) via Google Colab  

1. **Prepare data:**
   - Upload all datasets from the google drive
   - Update paths in training/test scripts accordingly

2. **Run training:**
   - There is a simple training section in the google colab notebook

3. **Run Test:**
   - There is a simple test section in the google colab notebook

## Dataset Overview

All datasets are in the google drive folder:
- `ecoli_train_12k.csv` â€“ Training set (12K sequences, 0â€“80 mutations each)
- `ecoli_val_750.csv` â€“ Validation set (750 sequences, 1 mutation each)
- `ecoli_test_5k.csv` â€“ Test set (5K sequences, 1 mutation each)
- `ecoli_test_low_mutation.csv` â€“ Test set (5K sequences, 0â€“2 mutations each)
